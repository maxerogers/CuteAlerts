Cute Alert!

This is a fun app that syncs with your Google Calendar and sends you alerts to remind you of your appointments--but not in a dull nagging boring way! In the same way that the significant other of your dreams would send you reminders. So you walk into the dentist's office with the warm and fuzzy feeling that someone out there cares about you (even though you think nobody does).

By Stephanie Liu and Maximilian Rogers

We used the Google Calendar API, Twilio, Bootstrap, Sinatra, Ruby, JS, HTML, and CSS

P.S. This is Stephanie's first Hackathon!
